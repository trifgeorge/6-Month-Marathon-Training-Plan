## Calculated Heart Rate Zones

Using the more accurate Karvonen Formula (which uses your Heart Rate Reserve), here are your suggested BPM ranges.

### Easy / Recovery Runs
*(Your Tuesday, Friday, Recovery Week runs)*

- **Purpose:** Build aerobic base, promote recovery, train your body to burn fat for fuel
- **Feel:** You can hold a full conversation easily
- **Karvonen Zone:** 60-70% of Heart Rate Reserve
- **Your BPM Range:** **137 - 149 BPM**

### Long Runs
*(Your Saturday runs)*

- **Purpose:** Build endurance and mental stamina. These should start easy and can progress to a "steady" effort in the later miles
- **Feel:** Conversational, but you'll be grateful for breaks in the conversation
- **Karvonen Zone:** 70-80% of Heart Rate Reserve
- **Your BPM Range:** **149 - 161 BPM**
  - *Start at the lower end of this range and let it drift up naturally*

### Tempo Runs
*(Your Wednesday workouts in Phases 2 & 3)*

- **Purpose:** Improve lactate threshold, so you can hold a faster pace for longer
- **Feel:** "Comfortably hard." You can speak only in short phrases (2-3 words at a time)
- **Karvonen Zone:** 80-90% of Heart Rate Reserve
- **Your BPM Range:** **161 - 173 BPM**

### Interval Sessions
*(Your 1km repeats)*

- **Purpose:** Improve VO2 Max and running economy

**The Hard Effort (1km):**
- **Feel:** Hard effort. Uncomfortable, breathing heavily. Speaking is not possible
- **Karvonen Zone:** 90-95% of Heart Rate Reserve
- **Your BPM Range:** **173 - 182 BPM**

**The Recovery Jog:**
- **Feel:** Slow and easy to allow your heart rate to come down significantly
- **Your BPM Range:** Should drop back down to your **Easy range (137-149 BPM)** or even lower

### Shakeout Runs
*(Your Friday runs)*

- **Purpose:** Promote blood flow and recovery. These should be *very* easy
- **Your BPM Range:** Stick to the lower end of your **Easy range, even 130-140 BPM**
